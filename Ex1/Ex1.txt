In this exercise you have to do the following:

create a database table for EMPLOYEEs - with integer id, with variable-length string for the name, a fixed length string with 3 letters for the country code (as nationality) and an employee_type enum type (employee, manager and CEO types).

later on we come to the conclusion that the id must be a primary key with auto increment feature

and we have to add an additional column to the gender - with two possible values male and female

let's insert 5 arbitrary emloyees into the database table

remove all employees from the USA

Good luck!
