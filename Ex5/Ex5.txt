In this exercise you have 2 database tables: employee and customer.



CREATE TABLE employee (
	first_name VARCHAR(20),
    last_name VARCHAR(20)
);
 
INSERT INTO employee VALUES("Kevin", "Spacey");
INSERT INTO employee VALUES("Joe", "Ranger");
 
CREATE TABLE customer (
	f_name VARCHAR(20),
    l_name VARCHAR(20)
);
 
INSERT INTO customer VALUES("Peter", "Thiel");
INSERT INTO customer VALUES("Elon", "Musk");
So you have these database tables and your task is to create a query with the concatenated first name and last name values (this column is called full_name). 
Finally you can sort the full_names in alphabetical order.


Good luck!
